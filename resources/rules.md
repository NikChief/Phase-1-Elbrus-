The content here is intended to help you remember and follow the basic rules of engagement at Elbrus Bootcamp. Remember that all staff are here to help you at any time. Look to your accountability buddies for support and guidance as well.


Ok, onwards with the rules.

## Distractions

Elbrus Bootcamp is a distraction-free zone. We are all on [maker's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

**No phones, email, facebook, twitter, tv, movies, hulu, netflix, etc or outside life during core hours.** You break this rule, we scowl at you (more seriously, you damage the quality of the learning environment). Repeat offenders might be asked to do an interpretive dance for the entire cohort.

If you want some private space, put some headphones on. If you see a student or a teacher with headphones on, do not distract them unless something is on fire, and you've already tried to put it out and failed.

## Absenteeism

**What if I'm late / skip a day / sick / don't want to come in?**

Elbrus Bootcamp requires all students to make [3 agreements: integrity, kindness and whole self](./three-agreements.md). If you are sick or have an emergency appointment that cannot be missed, it is your responsibility to notify your accountability buddies first and follow up with your teacher(s) to make sure they are aware of your necessary absence.

It is permissible to miss a day of class. However, you should be made aware that:

- This increases the likelihood that you will need to repeat the phase.
- You can only repeat a phase once. A second repeat is an automatic leave.

## Appropriate Use of Space

- Keep your desk clean.
- Keep the space presentable for potential employers and the tech community.
- Do the dishes!
- Do the smenka!
- If you are the last to leave, turn off the lights and make sure all the doors/windows are shut.

Other than that, you can rearrange the furniture, do movie nights, and generally make the space your own.

However, follow **the campsite rule**, leave the space better than you found it. When possible, return furniture to where it was set when you entered the space, and clean the space even if you did not create the mess.

## Community Integrity

Elbrus Bootcamp is a community and we keep the [three agreements](./three-agreements.md) in order to make this a safe and optimal learning environment for all.

However, there are some non-negotiable rules about being a part of the Elbrus Bootcamp community:

- Be in the space, on time, when the gong rings in the morning and after lunch.
- Be here for all of core hours and communicate any necessary absence or lateness.
- Communicate with your accountability group when you are struggling, late, or absent.
- Please be kind and courteous to the building staff. We are their guests, and it is all of our responsibility to be good guests.
- No food allowed near the computers.
- No alcohol allowed at Elbrus Bootcamp unless authorized by staff.
- No loud music allowed at Elbrus Bootcamp unless authorized by staff.

Phase 1 students have their own set of responsibilities:

- Attend yoga each week.
- Keep the space clean before the next cohort's orientation, for Elbrus Bootcamp , and any outside visits or speakers.

## Friday

### Morning checkpoint!

Do not forget to remind your teacher about it :)


### Sudoku

- [Sudoku Challenge](https://github.com/Elbrus-Bootcamp/project-sudoku/tree/master-eng)

### Git

### General recommendations

* One person forks a project
* The others clone the forked project
* Add everyone as collaborators
* Everyone works in their own branch
* Merge as often as you can!

### How to merge?

* git add -A
* git commit -m ""
* git push origin mybranch
* On github.com press "New pull request"
* Ask your teammate to check the pull-request
* After a teammate makes a pull request, you can update the changes using `git pull origin master` (but `master` may instead be `master-eng`, `main`, etc., you need to double check the name of the branch you are using as the "main" one).

### When to merge?

* 12:00
* 14:00
* 16:00
* 20 minutes before the presentation

### Create a new Issue
If you find a typo in an or an inaccuracy in the task, or you have a suggestion on how to improve a task - you need to create a new Issue.  
For this you need to:
1. Go to the project repository on GitHub
2. Click on the Issues tab.
3. Click the "New issue" button
4. Enter a title and a description of the issue
5. Click the button "Submit new issue".  
After that the new issue will be created and we will improve it after a while.


### Prepare for the day ahead
You are expected to do some reading for the topics in the day ahead. In the flipped classroom, it should not be the first time that you see a topic.

- Please, review once again [code writing standards] (https://github.com/leonidlebedev/javascript-airbnb) - this topic is very important. 
- Study thoroughly the concept of "Testing". Every developer should know what testing is, why you need to write the tests and what library is better to use. Get familiazed with unit testing libraries. For example, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).
